# HISTONE MODIFICATION NETWORK - CORRELATION BASED NETWORK

Histone modifications are epigenetic marks that play a critical role in modifying gene expression and regulatory region function, with implications in various diseases. However, loci-loci interactions across large genomic contexts within- and between- chromosomes present a significant challenge in understanding the importance of a given histone modification within a given genomic context.

Network based approach constructed within each chromosome can identify tissue-specified modules and high-rank loci overlaps with cellular regulatory functional terms.
